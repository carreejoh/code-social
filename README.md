# Routine-Scheduler
Routine-Scheduler is my take on a simple, yet effective way to manage my time. Users' are encouraged to make easy-to-understand "time blocks", of essential and priority events. I built this app to help me manage my time, and encourage consistent results. Every time a unique block is rendered Routine Scheduler tracks it as seen, and updates the users statistics giving them feedback on priority completion.

# Key Features
Statistics: This application tracks the user's blocks based on their priority, and gives feedback relating to completion percentage, and total number of tasks completed.
Instant Rendering: Redux.js and Next.js allow for speedy updates, and in cases instant re-rendering. This greatly improves the user experience.
Task Blocks: These blocks are incredibly intuitive, and fully customizable. All blocks can be edited in multiple ways, and interacting with them is incredibly easy.

# Getting Started
To use Routine-Scheduler follow these steps:
1. Go to https://routinescheduler.com
2. Make an account
3. Create your first block using the plus sign under the logo.

# Feedback and Support
If you have any suggestions or would like to report a bug you can reach me at carreejoh4637@gmail.com

# Future Updates
I'm currently working on implementing a couple of features, and fixing a couple of bugs.
1. Blocks cannot go "through" 12:00am
2. Adding a "To Do" list.
3. Making the site flex to mobile and smaller resolution screens.
